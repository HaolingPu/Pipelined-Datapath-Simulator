# Pipelined-Datapath-Simulator
This project is intended to understand in detail how a pipelined implementation works. I write a cycle-accurate behavioral simulator for a pipelined implementation of the LC-2K, complete with data forwarding and simple branch prediction. We have 5 pipeline register in this design: IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, MEM/WB, and WB/END.
